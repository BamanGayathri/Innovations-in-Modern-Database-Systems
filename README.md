This survey presents a detailed analysis of three cutting-edge approaches transforming modern database systems: (1) Stage, a hierarchical query execution time prediction system for Amazon Redshift; (2) a study evaluating the relational completeness and correctness of SQL, relational algebra, and relational calculus queries generated by ChatGPT; and (3) Limbo, a re-architecture of SQLite for serverless environments that uses asynchronous I/O to improve latency and scalability. These approaches represent three vital trends in database system evolution: machine learning-enhanced query optimization, AI-assisted code generation, and runtime/database architectural co-design. This report discusses the techniques, compares their strengths and weaknesses, presents empirical results, and concludes with insights on their practical impact.
